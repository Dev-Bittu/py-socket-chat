# py-socket-chat
This is an Python-based Secure Chat room. The project is entirely based on the Socket Progamming; done using Python. A server is set to the listening mode, with a specific IP Address and Port numner (that can be edited in the script) and clients are made to connect to the server. The messages are then broadcasted to all the clients present.
